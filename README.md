# Multi-Level-drop-down-menu
This is a way of creating multi-level drop down menu with HTML &amp; CSS. It's very easy and simple way. If you have basic idea about HTML &amp; CSS then you can use it in your project.

### Way of making it:
- create a HTML5 document
- Then create menu in menu-area
- write the CSS
- Done!

**you can also use it rather than make your own.**

## Have a look to the drop-down menu:
